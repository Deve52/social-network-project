1. npm init -y => this will generate a package.json file => add type moodule in init
2. create backend folder
3. server.js and make folder src and app.js in in
4. download the packages , it will store in package-lock.json()

DOUBT:
Q1. jab bohut  sare router.use wala middleware banaynge tho kuch routes ke 2 middle ware chlenge jaise default    wala aur coustome tho time aur efficiency ka issue hoga?

//req.body - when you pass the data in the body(alot of data generally authentication)
//req.query - when you pass the parameter!
//req.params - when you pass a specific data with the url like id or something!
